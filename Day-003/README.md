# Day 3 – Pandas Basics

Today I explored **Pandas**, focusing on Series, DataFrames, data selection, filtering, handling missing data, aggregation, grouping, and reading/writing CSV files for hands-on data manipulation and analysis.

## Key Points

- **Series & DataFrames:** Core 1D/2D labeled structures for storing data  
- **Selection & Filtering:** Access specific rows/columns and filter with conditions  
- **Missing Data:** Detect, drop, or fill missing values in datasets  
- **Column Operations:** Add or modify columns for new or transformed features  
- **Aggregation & Stats:** Compute sums, means, counts, and other summary statistics  
- **CSV I/O:** Read from and write datasets to CSV files efficiently

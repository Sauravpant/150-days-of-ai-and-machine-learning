### Day 3 – Introduction to Seaborn

Today I explored **Seaborn**, a high-level data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, used for creating clean and statistical visualizations with minimal code.

---

#### **Key Points**

- Used **Seaborn datasets** for quick experimentation (`tips`)
- Created **scatter, line, bar, box, violin, histogram, KDE plots**
- Visualized **pairwise relationships** using `pairplot`
- Computed correlations and visualized them with a **heatmap**
- Combined **Pandas + Seaborn** for grouped statistical plots
- Used **estimators** in bar plots for aggregation

# 150 Days of AI and Machine Learning

Welcome to my **150-day AI & Machine Learning journey**!  
This repository is the **starting point of my hands-on learning**, experiments, and projects in AI/ML. The goal is to **practice daily**, build skills from scratch, and document progress along the way.

> This is a **work in progress**—all content is being added day by day as I learn and implement concepts.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Learn **AI and Machine Learning from the ground up**
- Apply concepts in **daily coding exercises and notebooks**
- Build a portfolio of **mini-projects and capstone projects**
- Maintain a **daily log of progress** for accountability and reflection

---

## 📅 Repository Structure

The repository is organized **day-wise**, to track learning from the first day:

```
150-days-of-ai-and-machine-learning/
│
├── .venv/
├── Day/ # Example daily folder
│ ├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks
│ ├── notes.md # Key concepts, summaries, and observations
│ ├── data/ # Small datasets used for the day
├── Projects/ # Practice Projects
├── requirements.txt # Python package dependencies
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

> All code and notebooks are designed to run from a **single virtual environment** at the root of the repository.

---

## 📝 Daily Workflow

Each day is organized with a consistent workflow:

1. **Notebook (`notebooks/`)** – Experiment, implement, and test code
2. **Notes (`notes.md`)** – Record key concepts, insights, and observations
3. **Data (`data/`)** – Small datasets used for experiments

<h2>🛠️ Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Clone the repository</p>

```
git clone https://github.com//150-days-of-ai-and-machine-learning.git
```

<p>2. Create Virtual Environment  (Optional)</p>

```
python -m venv .venv
```

<p>3. Activate virtual environment:</p>

```
# Windows .venv\Scripts\activate
OR
# Linux / Mac source .venv/bin/activate
```

<p>4. Install dependencies:</p>

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<p>5. Launch Jupyter Lab from the root:</p>

```
jupyter lab
```

> All notebooks will use the root .venv kernel for consistent package management.

# Day 1 – NumPy Basics

Today I started working with **NumPy**, focusing on understanding how arrays work and how common numerical operations are performed efficiently in Python.

---

## Topics Covered

- What NumPy is and why it is used
- Creating 1D and 2D arrays
- Understanding ndarray properties (`ndim`, `shape`, `size`)
- Working with different data types
- Copying arrays safely
- Indexing and slicing arrays
- Performing element-wise arithmetic operations
- Using aggregation functions like `sum`, `max`, `min`, and `average`
- Axis-based computations on multi-dimensional arrays
- Reshaping, transposing, and reversing arrays
- Identifying unique elements in arrays
- Saving and loading NumPy arrays using `.npy` files

## Notes

This day focused on **hands-on practice** and building familiarity with NumPy’s core API rather than memorizing concepts. All learning was done through experimentation inside the notebook.

➡️ Next: deeper NumPy operations and array manipulation techniques.
